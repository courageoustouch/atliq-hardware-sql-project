# 📊 AtliQ Hardware – SQL Reporting & Business Insights Project

Welcome to the **AtliQ Hardware** case study – a realistic SQL portfolio project reflecting the day-to-day challenges faced by data analysts in fast-growing B2B companies.

This project showcases **end-to-end reporting tasks** using **MySQL Workbench**, simulating a scenario where a growing organization transitions from Excel-based reporting to a more scalable, structured **SQL-based analytics system**.

---

## 🧠 Project Background

AtliQ Hardware, a fictional B2B company dealing in computer peripherals, initially relied heavily on Excel for all analytics and reporting needs. As the business scaled and data volumes exploded, Excel crashed under the pressure.

To fix this, the CEO transitioned to **MySQL** and built a **Data Analytics Team** to deliver robust reports that support business growth.

As a **Data Analyst**, I:
- Interpreted reporting needs via JIRA tickets.
- Wrote performant, production-ready SQL queries.
- Generated output reports and validated results.
- Delivered actionable business insights beyond core requirements.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Transform raw transactional data into **actionable insights** that drive **data-informed decisions**.

**Key tasks included:**
- Creating sales and performance reports.
- Building reusable stored procedures.
- Visualizing key metrics in Excel.
- Providing business reasoning behind every report.

> 🔍 **Each Task folder contains following subfolders:

> - Main JIRA Task - This folder contains the primary solution for the main JIRA task assigned by the business team. The folder name includes the suffix "- n", where n corresponds to the JIRA task number.

> - Business Insights [n] - The number of these folders within the task folders can be between 1 to 3. These addresses the dentified hypothetical, high-impact questions that might be underlying the main JIRA task, hence generating actionable insights for the business team.

> - Optional: `Business Insights Validations/` with Excel validations


Within these subfolders, you will find below files - 
> - `SQL_Scripts/` with clean, commented SQL

> - `Report/` with deliverable CSV/Excel output

> - `Results/` with screenshots of query output
